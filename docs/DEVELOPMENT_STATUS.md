# Development Status

## Current phase

Phase 4 (app shell and design system) — code complete. Phase 3 auth and the signed-in shell have NOT been
verified against live Supabase (the sandbox cannot reach it); please try them locally.

## Completed

- Phase 0 audit; Phase 1 foundation; Phase 2 backend (migrations applied, RLS tests passing).
- Phase 3 code: register, login, logout, forgot/reset password, auth callback, protected routes via
  middleware, profile and workspace loaded on the home page. Shared zod schemas in `@kkingg/schemas`.
  Unsafe redirect targets are rejected; forgot-password gives the same response for any email.
- Verified locally: lint, format, typecheck, 16 unit tests, `next build`. Against a running production
  build: `/` and `/tasks` redirect to `/login` when signed out, auth pages return 200, a bad callback
  redirects to `/login` with an error and ignores an unsafe `next`.

- Phase 4 code: Tailwind v4 theme mirroring the design tokens; responsive shell (collapsible sidebar,
  mobile drawer, top bar) with navigation generated from the registry plus the workspace's enabled modules
  (`workspace_modules`); working workspace switcher (cookie validated against RLS-visible workspaces);
  account menu with sign out; settings page to edit name and time zone; module search (jumps to modules).

## Not verified

- Real registration, login and password reset against Supabase Auth: the sandbox network blocks the
  Supabase domain from the shell (403 from the proxy), so this must be tried from your machine.
  The signup database trigger itself was verified in SQL (RLS test creates users in `auth.users`).
- Email delivery and confirmation flow.

## Required configuration (owner)

- In Supabase Auth settings: set Site URL and add redirect URLs (`http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
  and the production URL); decide whether email confirmation is required. Not set by me.
- Local env: `apps/web/.env.local` (gitignored) holds the project URL and publishable key; copy from `.env.example`.
- Revoke the GitHub token that was pasted in chat.

## Not yet done

- Account deletion, data export, password change from settings.
- Notifications bell and AI assistant button are intentionally absent until their backends exist
  (Phases 8 and 16). The top-bar search only finds modules until universal search (Phase 9).
- Shell components (sidebar, menus) have no automated component tests yet; only logic is unit tested.
- `apps/mobile`, `apps/desktop`; storage buckets; Vault storage buckets.
- RLS tests are manual, not in CI. GitHub Actions not yet observed running.

## Exact next action

Owner tries sign-up/sign-in and the shell locally (`pnpm --filter @kkingg/web dev`) and reports problems.
Then Phase 5: dashboard and core productivity (tasks, projects, goals, calendar, reminders, habits) with
migrations, RLS and tests.
